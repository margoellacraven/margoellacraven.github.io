            <p>Hi, I'm Margo! Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
            <p>I am a third year journalism and film student at Fordham University in New York City. This is where you can get to know me a little better! I am orginally from Bend, Oregon, and came to New York City to pursue writing and film. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing guitar, and exploring the city with friends. I am a staff member at the Fordham Observer, where I write for the Arts and Culture Section. I love to travel, and plan to further my education studying abroad in Granada, Spain, next spring! Stay tuned for updates on my latest adventures!</p>
