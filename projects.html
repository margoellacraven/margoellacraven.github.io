        <p>I recently shot and directed a short documentary entitled DAT: Action Against Disaster, alongside fellow filmmaker Maddie Bamford, where we followed a day in the lives of four incredible volunteers who serve the New York City community through the American Red Cross Disaster Action Team. The team responds to both residential fires and natural disasters throughout the five boroughs of New York City, assisting victims of disasters with temporary housing, financial assistance, and provide necessities like food and clothing. We had the opportunity to accompany the DAT team on a shift, as well as shit down with each member of the team for an in-depth interview, giving them the opportunity to share their stories, and what their work DAT and the Red Cross means to them. Although we spent just eight hours with the DAT team, Maddie and I were deeply impacted by the experience of the shift, and incredibly grateful to the team for giving us the opportunity to create this film. We would like to thank the entire Red Cross community of greater New York, and extend a special thank you to Ramon Barreras, Alan Hensey, Jerry Rothstein, and Elias Higgs. Please enjoy the film.
